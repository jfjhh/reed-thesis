  abstract = {The competition between interactions and dissipative processes in a quantum many-body system can drive phase transitions of different order. Exploiting a combination of cluster methods and quantum trajectories, we show how the systematic inclusion of (classical and quantum) nonlocal correlations at increasing distances is crucial to determine the structure of the phase diagram, as well as the nature of the transitions in strongly interacting spin systems. In practice, we focus on the paradigmatic dissipative quantum Ising model: In contrast to the nondissipative case, its phase diagram is still a matter of debate in the literature. When dissipation acts along the interaction direction, we predict important quantitative modifications of the position of the first-order transition boundary. In the case of incoherent relaxation in the field direction, our approach confirms the presence of a second-order transition, while does not support the possible existence of multicritical points. Potentially, these results can be tested in up-to-date quantum simulators of Rydberg atoms.},

This novel long-term behavior for delay dynamics results from strongly asymmetric nonlinear delayed feedback driving a highly damped harmonic oscillator dynamics. In the corresponding virtual space-time representation, the behavior is found to develop as a chimeralike state, a new paradigmatic object from the network theory characterized by the coexistence of synchronous and incoherent oscillations. Numerous virtual chimera states are obtained and analyzed, through experiment, theory, and simulations.},

  abstract = {Quantum coherence plays an essential role in diverse natural phenomena and technological applications. The unavoidable coupling of the quantum system to an uncontrolled environment incurs dissipation that is often described using the secular approximation. Here we probe the limit of this approximation in the rotational relaxation of molecules due to thermal collisions by using the laser-kicked molecular rotor as a model system. Specifically, rotational coherences in N2O gas (diluted in He) are created by two successive nonresonant short and intense laser pulses and probed by studying the change of amplitude of the rotational alignment echo with the gas density. By interrogating the system at the early stage of its collisional relaxation, we observe a significant variation of the dissipative influence of collisions with the time of appearance of the echo, featuring a decoherence process that is well reproduced by the nonsecular quantum master equation for modeling molecular collisions.},

  abstract = {We experimentally and theoretically investigate the ultrafast collisional dynamics of a symmetric-top molecule (C2H6) in pure gas and mixtures with He at high density by employing the rotational alignment echo created by a pair of time-delayed intense laser kicks. The decrease of the amplitude of the echo when increasing the delay between the two laser pulses, reflecting the collisional relaxation of the system, is measured by probing the transient birefringence induced in the medium. The theoretical predictions, carried using purely classical molecular dynamics simulations, reproduce well the observed features, as demonstrated previously for a linear molecule. The analysis shows that the dissipation of the ethane alignment, despite the fact that this species has an extra rotational degree of freedom as compared to a linear molecule, barely involves more complex collisional relaxation channels due to characteristics of the C2H6-C2H6 and C2H6-He interactions. However, our findings reveal that the dissipative dynamics of a symmetric-top molecule can be properly approached using the recently discovered rotational alignment echoes, which, so far, have been only tested for probing rotational decoherence of simpler (linear) molecules.},

  abstract = {Realistic models of quantum systems must include dissipative interactions with a thermal environment. For weakly-damped systems, while the Lindblad-form Markovian master equation is invaluable for this task, it applies only when the frequencies of any subset of the system's transitions are degenerate, or their differences are much greater than the transitions' linewidths. Outside of these regimes the only available efficient description has been the Bloch\textendash Redfield master equation, the efficacy of which has long been controversial due to its failure to guarantee the positivity of the density matrix. The ability to efficiently simulate weakly-damped systems across all regimes is becoming increasingly important, especially in quantum technologies. Here we solve this long-standing problem by deriving a Lindblad-form master equation for weakly-damped systems that is accurate for all regimes. We further show that when this master equation breaks down, so do all time-independent Markovian equations, including the B-R equation. We thus obtain a replacement for the B-R equation for thermal damping that is no less accurate, simpler in structure, completely positive, allows simulation by efficient quantum trajectory methods, and unifies the previous Lindblad master equations. We also show via exact simulations that the new master equation can describe systems in which slowly-varying transition frequencies cross each other during the evolution. System identification tools, developed in systems engineering, play an important role in our analysis. We expect these tools to prove useful in other areas of physics involving complex systems.},

Here we combine the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group with techniques from the theory of orthogonal polynomials to provide an efficient method for simulating open quantum systems, including spin-boson models and their generalizations to multicomponent systems.},

The mapping of the stationary-state search problem into finding a zero-energy ground state of an appropriate Hermitian operator allows us to apply the conventional variational Monte Carlo method for the optimization. Our method is shown to simulate various spin systems efficiently, i.e., the transverse-field Ising models in both one and two dimensions and the XYZ model in one dimension.},
