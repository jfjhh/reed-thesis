For a certain range of values of the spin-spin coupling, magnetic field, and dissipation rate, we identify a first-order dynamical phase transition between active and inactive dynamical phases. We demonstrate that dynamical phase coexistence becomes manifest in an intermittent behavior of the bath quanta emission. Moreover, we establish the connection between the dynamical order parameter that quantifies the activity and the longitudinal magnetization that serves as static order parameter. The system that we consider can be implemented in current experiments with Rydberg atoms and trapped ions.},

  abstract = {In most introductory courses on quantum mechanics one is taught that the Hamiltonian operator must be Hermitian in order that the energy levels be real and that the theory be unitary (probability conserving). To express the Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian, one writes \$H=H\^\textbackslash dagger\$, where the symbol \$\textbackslash dagger\$ denotes the usual Dirac Hermitian conjugation; that is, transpose and complex conjugate. In the past few years it has been recognized that the requirement of Hermiticity, which is often stated as an axiom of quantum mechanics, may be replaced by the less mathematical and more physical requirement of space-time reflection symmetry (PT symmetry) without losing any of the essential physical features of quantum mechanics. Theories defined by non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit strange and unexpected properties at the classical as well as at the quantum level. This paper explains how the requirement of Hermiticity can be evaded and discusses the properties of some non-Hermitian PT-symmetric quantum theories.},

Both weakly and strongly damped systems are analyzed in the regime of low and high temperatures.},

The unavoidable coupling of the quantum system to an uncontrolled environment incurs dissipation that is often described using the secular approximation.

Specifically, rotational coherences in N2O gas (diluted in He) are created by two successive nonresonant short and intense laser pulses and probed by studying the change of amplitude of the rotational alignment echo with the gas density. By interrogating the system at the early stage of its collisional relaxation, we observe a significant variation of the dissipative influence of collisions with the time of appearance of the echo, featuring a decoherence process that is well reproduced by the nonsecular quantum master equation for modeling molecular collisions.},

  abstract = {The new quantum theory, based on the assumption that the dynamical variables do not obey the commutative law of multiplication, has by now been developed sufficiently to form a fairly complete theory of dynamics. One can treat mathematically the problem of any dynamical system composed of a number of particles with instantaneous forces acting between them, provided it is describable by a Hamiltonian function, and one can interpret the mathematics physically by a quite definite general method. On the other hand, hardly anything has been done up to the present on quantum electrodynamics. The questions of the correct treatment of a system in which the forces are propagated with the velocity of light instead of instantaneously, of the production of an electromagnetic field by a moving electron, and of the reaction of this field on the electron have not yet been touched. In addition, there is a serious difficulty in making the theory satisfy all the requirements of the restricted principle of relativity, since a Hamiltonian function can no longer be used. This relativity question is, of course, connected with the previous ones, and it will be impossible to answer any one question completely without at the same time answering them all. However, it appears to be possible to build up a fairly satisfactory theory of the emission of radiation and of the reaction of the radiation field on the emitting system on the basis of a kinematics and dynamics which are not strictly relativistic. This is the main object of the present paper. The theory is noil-relativistic only on account of the time being counted throughout as a c-number, instead of being treated symmetrically with the space co-ordinates. The relativity variation of mass with velocity is taken into account without difficulty. The underlying ideas of the theory are very simple. Consider an atom interacting with a field of radiation, which we may suppose for definiteness to be confined in an enclosure so as to have only a discrete set of degrees of freedom. Resolving the radiation into its Fourier components, we can consider the energy and phase of each of the components to be dynamical variables describing the radiation field. Thus if Er is the energy of a component labelled r and \texttheta r is the corresponding phase (defined as the time since the wave was in a standard phase), we can suppose each Er and \texttheta r to form a pair of canonically conjugate variables. In the absence of any interaction between the field and the atom, the whole system of field plus atom will be describable by the Hamiltonian H = {$\Sigma$}rEr + Ho equal to the total energy, Ho being the Hamiltonian for the atom alone, since the variables Er, \texttheta r obviously satisfy their canonical equations of motion Er = \textemdash{} {$\partial$}H/{$\partial\theta$}r = 0, \texttheta r = {$\partial$}H/{$\partial$}Er = 1.},

  abstract = {The equilibrium properties of a magnetic impurity in a metal are discussed in the long-time approximation introduced by Nozi\`eres and de Dominicis for the x-ray threshold problem. It is shown that the free energy satisfies an exact homogeneity condition, from which it is possible to display explicitly the structure of the singularities of perturbation theory in the exchange coupling J as the magnetic field H\textrightarrow 0 and the temperature T\textrightarrow 0. The nature of the Kondo problem is made clear and it is shown that, for antiferromagnetic coupling, when H=0 and T=0, physical properties are expected to be nonanalytic functions of J. To resolve those problems, the partition function is first shown to be exactly the same as that of a spin-1/2 interacting with a certain boson field. The ground-state properties are then studied by finding a new division of the spin-boson Hamiltonian into two parts, such that perturbation theory is finite term by term. For antiferromagnetic coupling, the moment vanishes at T=0 and for weak ferromagnetic coupling, the free moment is only slightly renormalized. The partition function is also shown to be equivalent to that of an unusual one-dimensional Ising model. For T{$\neq$}0, the free energy is intensive. For T=0, the free energy is extensive and the interaction follows an inverse-square law at large distances but is infinitely strong for neighboring spins. The method of solving the spin-boson problem is worked out explicitly for the Ising model and in this way extended to finite temperatures.},

The first part of this paper aims at introducing a mathematical oriented reader to the realm of Quantum Mechanics (QM) and then to present the geometric structures that underline the mathematical formalism of QM which, contrary to what is usually done in Classical Mechanics (CM), are usually not taught in introductory courses. The mathematics related to Hilbert spaces and Differential Geometry are assumed to be known by the reader. In the second part, we concentrate on some quantization procedures, that are founded on the geometric structures of QM \textemdash{} as we have described them in the first part \textemdash{} and represent the ones that are more operatively used in modern theoretical physics. We will discuss first the so-called Coherent State Approach which, mainly complemented by "Feynman Path Integral Technique", is the method which is most widely used in quantum field theory. Finally, we will describe the "Weyl Quantization Approach" which is at the origin of modern tomographic techniques, originally used in optics and now in quantum information theory.},

Of note, this theorem also works for 2-dimensional vector spaces and for vector spaces over the rational numbers, where the standard Gleason theorem fails. 2) A way of rewriting the quantum collapse rule so that it looks almost precisely identical to Bayes rule for updating probabilities in classical probability theory.

The suspicion is expressed that no end will be in sight until a means is found to reduce quantum theory to two or three statements of crisp physical (rather than abstract, axiomatic) significance. In this regard, no tool appears better calibrated for a direct assault than quantum information theory. Far from a strained application of the latest fad to a time-honored problem, this method holds promise precisely because a large part--but not all--of the structure of quantum theory has always concerned information. It is just that the physics community needs reminding. This paper, though taking quant-ph/0106166 as its core, corrects one mistake and offers several observations beyond the previous version. In particular, I identify one element of quantum mechanics that I would not label a subjective term in the theory--it is the integer parameter D traditionally ascribed to a quantum system via its Hilbert-space dimension.},

In this paper it is shown that quantum theory can be derived from five very reasonable axioms. The first four of these are obviously consistent with both quantum theory and classical probability theory. Axiom 5 (which requires that there exists continuous reversible transformations between pure states) rules out classical probability theory. If Axiom 5 (or even just the word "continuous" from Axiom 5) is dropped then we obtain classical probability theory instead. This work provides some insight into the reasons quantum theory is the way it is. For example, it explains the need for complex numbers and where the trace formula comes from.

  abstract = {We show that short-range correlations have a dramatic impact on the steady-state phase diagram of quantum driven-dissipative systems. This effect, never observed in equilibrium, follows from the fact that ordering in the steady state is of dynamical origin, and is established only at very long times, whereas in thermodynamic equilibrium it arises from the properties of the (free) energy. To this end, by combining the cluster methods extensively used in equilibrium phase transitions to quantum trajectories and tensor-network techniques, we extend them to nonequilibrium phase transitions in dissipative many-body systems. We analyze in detail a model of spin-1/2 on a lattice interacting through an XYZ Hamiltonian, each of them coupled to an independent environment that induces incoherent spin flips. In the steady-state phase diagram derived from our cluster approach, the location of the phase boundaries and even its topology radically change, introducing reentrance of the paramagnetic phase as compared to the single-site mean field where correlations are neglected. Furthermore, a stability analysis of the cluster mean field indicates a susceptibility towards a possible incommensurate ordering, not present if short-range correlations are ignored.},

Exploiting a combination of cluster methods and quantum trajectories, we show how the systematic inclusion of (classical and quantum) nonlocal correlations at increasing distances is crucial to determine the structure of the phase diagram, as well as the nature of the transitions in strongly interacting spin systems. In practice, we focus on the paradigmatic dissipative quantum Ising model: In contrast to the nondissipative case, its phase diagram is still a matter of debate in the literature. When dissipation acts along the interaction direction, we predict important quantitative modifications of the position of the first-order transition boundary. In the case of incoherent relaxation in the field direction, our approach confirms the presence of a second-order transition, while does not support the possible existence of multicritical points. Potentially, these results can be tested in up-to-date quantum simulators of Rydberg atoms.},

  abstract = {Historically, noise in superconducting circuits has been considered an obstacle to be removed. A large fraction of the research effort in designing superconducting circuits has focused on noise reduction, with great success, as coherence times have increased by four orders of magnitude in the past two decades. However, noise and dissipation can never be fully eliminated, and further, a rapidly growing body of theoretical and experimental work has shown that carefully tuned noise, in the form of engineered dissipation, can be a profoundly useful tool in designing and operating quantum circuits. In this article, I review important applications of engineered dissipation, including state generation, state stabilization, and autonomous quantum error correction, where engineered dissipation can mitigate the effect of intrinsic noise, reducing logical error rates in quantum information processing. Further, I provide a pedagogical review of the basic noise processes in superconducting qubits (photon loss and phase noise), and argue that any dissipative mechanism which can correct photon loss errors is very likely to automatically suppress dephasing. I also discuss applications for quantum simulation, and possible future research directions.},

Restricting the support of the operator to \$M\$ consecutive spins along the chain, we exhaustively search for the operator that minimizes the Frobenius norm of the commutator with the Hamiltonian. We first show that the Frobenius norm bounds the time scale of relaxation of the operator at high temperatures. We find operators with significantly slower relaxation than the slowest simple "hydrodynamic" mode due to energy diffusion. Then, we examine some properties of the nontrivial slow operators. Using both exhaustive search and tensor network techniques, we find similar slowly relaxing operators for a Floquet spin chain; this system is hydrodynamically "trivial", with no conservation laws restricting their dynamics. We argue that such slow relaxation may be a generic feature following from locality and unitarity.},

A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous correlation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short- and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter {$\lambda$} which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determining long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 12 systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system.},

  abstract = {Realistic models of quantum systems must include dissipative interactions with a thermal environment. For weakly-damped systems, while the Lindblad-form Markovian master equation is invaluable for this task, it applies only when the frequencies of any subset of the system's transitions are degenerate, or their differences are much greater than the transitions' linewidths. Outside of these regimes the only available efficient description has been the Bloch\textendash Redfield master equation, the efficacy of which has long been controversial due to its failure to guarantee the positivity of the density matrix. The ability to efficiently simulate weakly-damped systems across all regimes is becoming increasingly important, especially in quantum technologies. Here we solve this long-standing problem by deriving a Lindblad-form master equation for weakly-damped systems that is accurate for all regimes. We further show that when this master equation breaks down, so do all time-independent Markovian equations, including the B-R equation. We thus obtain a replacement for the B-R equation for thermal damping that is no less accurate, simpler in structure, completely positive, allows simulation by efficient quantum trajectory methods, and unifies the previous Lindblad master equations. We also show via exact simulations that the new master equation can describe systems in which slowly-varying transition frequencies cross each other during the evolution. System identification tools, developed in systems engineering, play an important role in our analysis. We expect these tools to prove useful in other areas of physics involving complex systems.},

Here it is shown that this common assumption is not universally true: a universally valid trade-off relation between the noise and the disturbance has an additional correlation term, which is redundant when the intervention brought by the measurement is independent of the measured object, but which allows the noise-disturbance product much below Planck's constant when the intervention is dependent. A model of measuring interaction with dependent intervention shows that Heisenberg's lower bound for the noise-disturbance product is violated even by a nearly nondisturbing precise position measurement. An experimental implementation is also proposed to realize the above model in the context of optical quadrature measurement with currently available linear optical devices.},

  abstract = {Multicomponent quantum systems in strong interaction with their environment are receiving increasing attention due to their importance in a variety of contexts, ranging from solid state quantum information processing to the quantum dynamics of biomolecular aggregates. Unfortunately, these systems are difficult to simulate as the system-bath interactions cannot be treated perturbatively and standard approaches are invalid or inefficient. Here we combine the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group with techniques from the theory of orthogonal polynomials to provide an efficient method for simulating open quantum systems, including spin-boson models and their generalizations to multicomponent systems.},

  abstract = {We generalize the method of third quantization to a unified exact treatment of Redfield and Lindblad master equations for open quadratic systems of n fermions in terms of diagonalization of 4n x 4n matrix. Non-equilibrium thermal driving in terms of the Redfield equation is analyzed in detail. We explain how to compute all physically relevant quantities, such as non-equilibrium expectation values of local observables, various entropies or information measures, or time evolution and properties of relaxation. We also discuss how to exactly treat explicitly time dependent problems. The general formalism is then applied to study a thermally driven open XY spin 1/2 chain. We find that recently proposed non-equilibrium quantum phase transition in the open XY chain survives the thermal driving within the Redfield model. In particular, the phase of long-range magnetic correlations can be characterized by hypersensitivity of the non-equilibrium-steady state to external (bath or bulk) parameters. Studying the heat transport we find negative thermal conductance for sufficiently strong thermal driving, as well as non-monotonic dependence of the heat current on the strength of the bath coupling.},

It is argued that even though the time evolution cannot be simulated efficiently due to fast entanglement growth, the steady states in and out of equilibrium can be typically accurately approximated, with the result that chains of length of the order of n{$\approx$}100 spins are accessible. Our results are demonstrated by performing explicit simulations of steady states and calculations of energy/spin densities/currents in several problems of heat and spin transport in quantum spin chains. A previously conjectured relation between quantum chaos and normal transport is re-confirmed with high accuracy for much larger systems.},

Shankar attacks the problem head-on in the first chapter, and in a very informal style suggests that there is nothing to be frightened of." (Physics Bulletin)  Reviews of the Second Edition:  "This massive text of 700 and odd pages has indeed an excellent get-up, is very verbal and expressive, and has extensively worked out calculational details---all just right for a first course. The style is conversational, more like a corridor talk or lecture notes, though arranged as a text. ... It would be particularly useful to beginning students and those in allied areas like quantum chemistry." (Mathematical Reviews)    R. Shankar has introduced major additions and updated key presentations in this second edition of Principles of Quantum Mechanics. New features of this innovative text include an entirely rewritten mathematical introduction, a discussion of Time-reversal invariance, and extensive coverage of a variety of path integrals and their applications. Additional highlights include:  - Clear, accessible treatment of underlying mathematics - A review of Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian mechanics - Student understanding of quantum theory is enhanced by separate treatment of mathematical theorems and physical postulates - Unsurpassed coverage of path integrals and their relevance in contemporary physics  The requisite text for advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level students, Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Second Edition is fully referenced and is supported by many exercises and solutions. The book's self-contained chapters also make it suitable for independent study as well as for courses in applied disciplines.},

Many quantum phenomena are found to have analogues within this toy theory. These include the noncommutativity of measurements, interference, the multiplicity of convex decompositions of a mixed state, the impossibility of discriminating nonorthogonal states, the impossibility of a universal state inverter, the distinction between bipartite and tripartite entanglement, the monogamy of pure entanglement, no cloning, no broadcasting, remote steering, teleportation, entanglement swapping, dense coding, mutually unbiased bases, and many others. The diversity and quality of these analogies is taken as evidence for the view that quantum states are states of incomplete knowledge rather than states of reality. A consideration of the phenomena that the toy theory fails to reproduce, notably, violations of Bell inequalities and the existence of a Kochen-Specker theorem, provides clues for how to proceed with this research program.},

Although these systems are promising for technological applications, they also present conceptual challenges, as they require approaches beyond mean-field and perturbation theory. Here we develop a general framework for identifying the free theory that is closest to a given interacting model in terms of their ground-state correlations. Moreover, we quantify the distance between them using the entanglement spectrum. When this interaction distance is small, the optimal free theory provides an effective description of the low-energy physics of the interacting model. Our construction of the optimal free model is non-perturbative in nature; thus, it offers a theoretical framework for investigating strongly correlated systems.},

The density matrix is defined here by the formula giving the mean values of physical quantities, which implies the same properties as the usual definition in terms of state vectors and their probabilities. This change in the description of physical states opens up a large variety of new ways that the density matrix may transform under various symmetries, different from the unitary transformations of ordinary quantum mechanics. Such new transformation properties have been explored before, but so far only for the symmetry of time translations into the future, treated as a semigroup. Here, new transformation properties are studied for general symmetry transformations forming groups, not just semigroups. Arguments that such symmetries should act on the density matrix as in ordinary quantum mechanics are presented, but all of these arguments are found to be inconclusive.},
