\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis studies open quantum systems and their relaxation to thermal
equilibrium. Candidate systems for use in quantum sensing or computing often
require long coherence times, but models of the environment-induced decoherence
these systems face are often simplistic. We consider a more complete model for
the relaxation of two to five spins in the transverse-field Ising model as they
interact with an electromagnetic bath at some temperature. As the field strength
is tuned for an appropriately renormalized Hamiltonian, a single spin is found
to vary its relaxation time by approximately a factor of ten for all
temperatures.
